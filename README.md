# The Vault of the Mine

Here lies the locker of all the NFO's, filtering scripts, mediainfos and checksums for the many releases done by me

## Structure

```
root
â”œâ”€â”€ Title.Year.Res.Source.Audio.{Codec|Encoder}-{GEM|ZINE}
|   â”œâ”€â”€ checksum.sha3 - Checksum for file integrity and authenticity
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mediainfo.txt - mediainfo output
|   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md     - The main document about the process used for this release and motovation/goal
|   â”œâ”€â”€ script.vpy    - The vapoursynth script used for filtering/decoding
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nfo           - copy of the NFO about the release i.e. source and notes
```

## Why

Kinda made this to archive what I have done and share it about because the more knowledge about with no barrier to entry the better especially when upon the high seas

but do note that this is for educating not to share any posible infringing materials there are plenty of places that are hidden in plain sight for those needs

## Who

While at the moment I am just a lone encoder that may change or might get some more people to contribute to this

there are two groups that release all the content that is documented here

- **GEM** encodes movies ðŸ’Ž
- **ZINE** is not encoded ðŸ“°
