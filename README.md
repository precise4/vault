# The Vault of the Mine

Here lies the locker of all the NFO's, filtering scripts, mediainfos and checksums for the many releases done by me

## Structure

```
root
├── Title.Year.Res.Source.Audio.{Codec|Encoder}-{GEM|ZINE}
|   ├── checksum.sha3 - Checksum for file integrity and authenticity
│   ├── mediainfo.txt - mediainfo output
|   ├── README.md     - The main document about the process used for this release and motovation/goal
|   ├── script.vpy    - The vapoursynth script used for filtering/decoding
│   └── nfo           - copy of the NFO about the release i.e. source and notes
```

## Why

Kinda made this to archive what I have done and share it about because the more knowledge about with no barrier to entry the better especially when upon the high seas
